# peak-alignment-for-mass-spectrometry
This code automates aligning similar peaks across different mass spect runs based on a user specified m/z tolerance value

Instructions:
1. To Run the code, click on the Example spredsheet
2. Click View > Macros
3. a window will pop up and select the name "sorting"
4. Click Run (it will run the code on whichever sheet is active. In the example case, it will run the example)
5. A window will pop up asking you what the max difference should be
6. A new sheet will be produced with the aligned peaks. Peak that are more than the difference but less than 0.1 will be highlighted red, as these peaks may or may not need more inspection.
7. If you wish to see the source code, hit Alt+F11. The code are under Module and Class Module



Thanks for using. Please cite.
